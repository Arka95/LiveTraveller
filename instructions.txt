The server folder contains the js file which is the signalling server for our app. 
make sure to change the url in the server.js to your machine's dynamic url (ipconfig)
the app is using 000webhost's server. the link details are in the AppConfig class in the app's src folder
for the time being, it uses peer to peer connection for video streaming, since we dont have a relay server.
More modifications to be made very soon
